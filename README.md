# MetroWay - Find Your way in the Metro!
Code for UHack 2015!

## Description
This application is a design and verification of the usage of Dijkstra's algorithm in order to find the shortest path in a subway system. This application also implements a graphical user interface to select the subway analyzed and in order to allow for users to add new vertices to the graph as well as create new graphs for the algorithm to verify. Further, included with this project are plans for the St. Petersburg Subway as well as the Miami Metromover.
